# Your application, on wheels
```fennel
(local trucks (require :trucks))

(do
  (trucks.mkconfig!))

(trucks.system! {:panic "unwind"
  :verbose "true"})

(trucks.defaults! {:run-ctx "npm"
  :cmd "run devstart"
  :sync "npm install"})

(trucks.service! :fe {:github "mattg1243/sb-frontend"})
(trucks.service! :courier {:github "phasewalk1/courier"
                   :run-ctx "cargo"
                   :cmd "watch-x run"})

(local contract (trucks.contract!))

```

Working in a small team but want to onboard new developers without having them clone and run every service? *skateboard* provides an automated approach to bundling your system by using a single contract file, and provides bindings for generating bootstrap scripts to help you automate onboarding and focus on shipping.
## Features
- [trucks](https://github.com/phasewalk1/skateboard/blob/master/contracts/trucks.contract.fnl)
    - Write wheels for your applications in a Lisp syntax using skateboard's [trucks library](https://github.com/phasewalk1/skateboard/blob/master/trucks/trucks.fnl) in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org)
    - _skateboard_ embeds any necessary dependencies so you can get started right away with `skateboard install`
- Sync service repositories
- Run the system and all itâ€™s services with goroutines in a single shell with unified logs
  - A user in possession of a valid _trucks contract_ can spin up the application in a single command, `skateboard up`

## Installation

### Install the skateboard binary with go

```bash
 go install github.com/phasewalk1/skateboard@latest
```

Try to run `skateboard -h` to ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in path, usually at `~/go/bin/` or `/usr/local/go/bin`.

### Install trucks
This will create a home for skateboard at `$HOME/.skateboard`, and will sync and build any dependencies needed to work with trucks. 
```bash
 skateboard install

## Usage / Examples
### Create a new contract
You can scaffold a new contract by running
```bash
skateboard new my-contract
```
This will create a directory at `my-contract/` and initialize it as a git repository; it also scaffolds an example contract for you at `trucks.contract.fnl` that looks exactly like the example contract above.

### Share your wheels
Once you've defined your application in a trucks contract, you can share the contract with anyone who has _skateboard installed_. Once they have your contract, they can run your application on wheels by navigating to the directory the contract is in and running
```bash
skateboard up
```
